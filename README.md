## Some themeing...

As I don't like the way Kali Linux looks by default, I started doing some light themeing for XFCE.

Uses the Catppuccin Mocha theme with Papirus Icons for a little spin on a familiar OS.

This repo is meant to be used with my kali-automation scripts to create themed VMs with relatively little effort using Ansible.
